There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the loader itself.

4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in the 3D tiles component, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

Thank you for contributing!
